# ERRORS
- messages come in backwards after page reload

# font optimisation

when modifiying the page / using more charachters of the cute font, remember to rerun fontconfig
i might make an intergration to automatically run it over the page so that i dont have to manually run it
another thing is maybe figuring out how to strip it down to just `Cute` instead of all chars
